"# castle-company" 
Based on following assumption

You can always build a castle at the start of the array, provided it is non-empty

● We only want to build one castle per peak or valley.

● A peak is an integer or series of integers that is above the immediately preceding and following

ints. For example, in the sequence [2,6,6,6,3] the sequence of 3 6s is a peak.

● A valley is an integer or series of integers that is below the immediately preceding and

following ints. For example, in the sequence [6,1,4] the "1" would be a valley.
